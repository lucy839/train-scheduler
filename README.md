## Conflicts & Solution
-   First learning of firebase was interesting, but challenging. Achieving current time and calculation related was little bit challening, but these were resolved using moment();

## Techinical Approach
-   javascript, jQuery (especially onclick function), setinterval and firebase

## Future
-   Incorporate API to achieve current location and actual bus data to make this app more useful
